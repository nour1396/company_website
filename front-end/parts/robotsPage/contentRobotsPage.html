            <p>We offer a wide range of the In-Mould labeling robots for the injection molding machines, our mechanical designs offer a high accuracy and repeatability and our control systems supply the high speeds and fast cycle times for massive productivity.
                We offer two types of IML Robots: Top entry IML Robots, Prefarely used in medium and high tonnage IMMs for the high pay load ranges and long axes strokes and also it's perfect for places with little spaces around. Side entry IML Robots,
                Advisable for the fast cycle times and high speed performances, with a very rigid structure that absorbs all types of kinetic energy and vibrantions to give the end effector to move and be posisioned smoothly with very high speeds accurately.

                        But the following also applies: Increased power respectively an enhanced functionality of our components open up new possibilities for you, which allow you to improve your products, plants and systems, offer your customers added
                        value, and expand your market position. This can, however, only be implemented at reasonable expense to a certain extent within a device generation. One day you will be confronted with limits which can no longer be surpassed using
                        the existing technology, but require a new approach to be applied. Regarding our proven MICROMASTER drives, this point has already been reached. We have therefore decided to replace the MICROMASTER drives by systems belonging to
                        the current SINAMICS drives family.

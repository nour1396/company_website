                    <p class="px-2">The central processing units (CPUs) are the heart of the SIMATIC S7-1500. They execute the user program and network the controller with other automation components. Thanks to numerous innovations, the CPUs of the SIMATIC S7-1500 deliver
                        the ultimate plus in productivity and efficiency. The hardware is extremely compact and certified to IP20 or IP65/67 standard. These highly integrated, highly versatile modules save space in and around the cabinet and reduce the
                        spare parts inventory costs.

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">- Overview of SIMATIC S7-1500 CPUs</p>
                    <p class="px-2"> The scope ranges from standard and failsafe CPUs for small to midsize requirements, offering compact size designs with integrated inputs and outputs, supplemented with technological functions, all the way up to most demanding high-performance
                        applications. Wherever an integration of high-level language C/C++ as PLC function or as self-contained application is needed, multifunctional platform CPUs come into play. For applications in the field of midrange motion control,
                        technology CPUs provide support with extended motion control features. Special requirements regarding robustness or environmental conditions are covered with a separate SIPLUS device family.

                    <p class="px-2 font-weight-bold">- Scalability, performance, and usability</p>
                    <p class="px-3">SIMATIC S7-1500/ET 200MP signal or periphery modules are the interface between controller and process. They can be used centrally on the SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU or in a decentralized SIMATIC ET 200MP peripheral system. Signal modules â€“
                        always the right solution for every job Sensors enable the controller to determine current process status. The digital and analog modules provide the inputs and outputs the various actuators need to perform their tasks.
